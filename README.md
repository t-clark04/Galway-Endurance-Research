# Athlete Endurance Research (Fall 2024 - Galway, Ireland)

Repository containing all of my R code written over the course of my research module on blood lactate endurance markers with Dr. John Newell at the University of Galway in Fall 2024. All code has been combined and summarized in one R Markdown file (best to open up the .html file in a browser tab).

Project was to utilize smoothing P-splines and cubic regression in R to calculate, illustrate, and interpret a variety of endurance markers for a given dataset, with the ultimate goal of improving upon the underlying functions in the widely-used 'Lactate-OR' Shiny application.

Also developed initial frameworks for calculating confidence intervals for the two most consistent lactate markers, FBLC and D2LMax, to quantify uncertainty and lend researchers greater confidence in interpreting differences in marker values.
